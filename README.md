# Gatsby Starter Tailwind CSS

Start your project quickly with this Tailwind CSS starter. This starter provides you with the basics to get up and running quickly with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

This starter uses Tailwind CSS v1.4.1 and therefore includes built-in PurgeCSS support through Tailwind itself. The starter sets you up with the following:

- `src/css/tailwind.css` where Tailwind's `base`, `components` and `utilities` directives are injected
- `tailwind.config.js` where you can customise the [Tailwind configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration/)
- `prettier`
- `gatsby-plugin-postcss` including `autoprefixer`
- `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`
- `gatsby-plugin-manifest`

## Demo site
